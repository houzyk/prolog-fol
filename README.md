# prolog-fol

Modelling FOL statements in Prolog.

## Run (Mac)

1. Install gnu-prolog using `brew install gnu-prolog`

2. lauch the gnu-prolog with `gprolog` in the directory containing the prolog files 

3. load a prolog file into gnu-prolog using `[<FILENAME>].`


Note:

Prolog files end in .pl which shares the same extension as with Perl. So, you may wanna let your IDE know that you're in Prolog and not in Perl.
